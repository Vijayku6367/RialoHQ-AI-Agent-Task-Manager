# RialoHQ-AI-Agent-Task-Manager
RialoHQ AI Agent Task Manager


This is an **independent, unofficial Ai Agent repository** inspired by **Rialo** — a next-generation blockchain built to enable real-world, real-time applications, without the need for bridges, oracles, or complex middleware.

## Why Rialo Matters

- **Event-Driven Architecture**  
  Rialo smart contracts react natively to external events (such as APIs, webhooks, or sensors), enabling automation without constant polling or external triggers.

- **True Web2–Web3 Integration**  
  Applications can communicate directly with the internet — for example, receiving Stripe webhooks, shipping updates, or live asset prices — without additional infrastructure.

- **Built for Developers**  
  Compatible with both RISC-V and the Solana VM, Rialo reduces friction and allows code reuse, making it easier to port existing applications.

- **Backed for Scale**  
  In August 2025, Rialo raised **$20M** from top investors including Pantera Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Fabric Ventures, and others — positioning it to drive real-world blockchain use cases.

## About This Starter Project

## Learn by Doing — My Goals

- Improve my ability to **document projects** clearly (using GitHub, Markdown, and Python scripts).
- Practice **publishing code and ideas** to grow my GitHub presence from scratch.
- Lay the foundation for **more advanced contributions** once I have access to the Rialo DevNet or SDK.

---

## What’s Next?

- Add a more advanced script simulating an **event trigger** or event-based logic.
- Expand documentation with **pseudocode** for Rialo-inspired interactions.
- Once access is available, build a **beginner’s Rialo tutorial**.
